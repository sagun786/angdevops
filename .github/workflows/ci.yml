##A project can have multiple workflow files like build, release, etc, 
##but for the sake of simplicity, weâ€™ll be using only one file for this project.


##GitHub is flexible with however you want to name your workflow file, 
## but the file has to be a yaml file and it has to be in the .github/workflows folder.
name: ci


## A workflow trigger is required for a workflow. 
## I configured the workflow to trigger on pushes to the master branch
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - 'master'

## In order to reduce build time and build complexity,
## I will keep as much work inside one job as possible.
## Job below is created to build and test the Angular application

jobs:
  ci:
    name: Build and Test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    ## Both setup node and the Dockerfile configuration should start from the same image container
      
    container: 
      image: node
      
    steps: 
        - uses: actions/checkout@v1
        - name: Install & Tests
          env:
            CHROME_BIN: '/usr/bin/google-chrome'
          run: |
            npm install
        ##npm test
